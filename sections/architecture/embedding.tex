\section{Preprocessing and Embedding}\label{sec:preprocessing-and-embedding}
Preprocessing and embedding of queries are done inside the \verb|embedding| group of components.
In this group, the system receives the embedding from the web framework controller, and starts the embedding process.
Before transforming the specification into a vector of floating point numbers, it must be preprocessed. \\ \\
In the preprocessing stage, we extract all the specification tags that contain natural language.
After the extraction of these values, they are all inserted into a string which is passed to the Markdown remover component.
This component will strip from the string all of those symbols and structures that are used to defined Markdown components.
Moreover, the string is cleaned of all URL, even if they are not in a Markdown format. \\ \\
Once the string has been properly cleaned, it is passed to the USE model via a POST request.
The model will then return a 512-dimension array of floating point numbers representing the string in a 512-dimensional space.
