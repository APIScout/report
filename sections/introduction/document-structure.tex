\section{Document Structure}\label{sec:document-structure}
This document has been divided into several different chapters.
Each chapter describes the different steps that allowed us to complete this project.
More specifically, we have seven chapters.

    \item \textbf{Background} In this chapter, we talk about the state-of-the-art, as well as the research that has already been done in the field of Web API description embedding and indexing.
    \item \textbf{Feasibility Study} This chapter explains in detail the experimentation that has been carried out to study in depth the dataset,
    as well as to support our architectural and implementation decisions.
    \item \textbf{Architecture} Here we go over the architecture of API Scout and the reasons behind such architectural decisions.
    \item \textbf{Implementation} This chapter explains in detail how API Scout works, from the Web framework to the DSL compiler.
    \item \textbf{Deployment} In this chapter, we discuss all the scripts and steps that were taken to deploy the service to a remote server.
    \item \textbf{Evaluation} Here, we analyze some experiments we performed on API Scout with several different queries and report the results of such experiments.
    \item \textbf{Conclusion} Finally, we have a brief concluding summary of the project and suggestions on how to further improve API Scout.
