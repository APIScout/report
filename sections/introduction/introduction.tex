\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}
In the ever-evolving landscape of software engineering, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) play a pivotal role in facilitating the communication and interoperability between software services.
When a system needs to expose some API endpoints to outside actors, such as developers or users, it is always good practice to keep track and document such endpoints. \\ \\
In this thesis, we are going to build a tool that can be used by both academics and developers to explore HTTP API documents -- written using the OpenAPI Specification language -- by searching through the plethora of documents we have collected. \\ \\
HTTP APIs are endpoints exposed by Web services and are accessible through HTTP requests.
To have a universal way of documenting this kind of APIs, in 2011 Swagger proposed the \("\)Swagger Specification\("\) (now OpenAPI Specification), a specification language that became the de facto industry standard for the documentation of HTTP APIs. As Swagger explains on its website, \("\)[t]he OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to HTTP APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service [\dots]\("\)~\cite{noauthor_openapi_nodate}.
