\chapter{Deployment}\label{ch:deployment}
The deployment of the API Scout platform is divided into three main parts: databases, machine learning model, and web sever.
A general deployment structure can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:deployment-architecture}.
The databases run on two separate containers, one for the MongoDB instance, and one for the Elasticsearch instance.
The embedding machine learning model runs in a separate container, as does the web server.
All of these containers communicate together with a common Docker network, and only port 80 can be accessed from the outside.
