\section{Summary and Outlook}\label{sec:summary-and-outlook}
In this chapter, we have seen what an OpenAPI specification is, and how we can leverage deep-learning models to create vector embeddings representing the semantic meaning of the sentence they are encoding.
Moreover, we have also seen how we can use HNSW to speed up an approximate K-NN search.
Finally, we also had a look at the works in literature that are related with this thesis.
In the following chapters, we will describe the early results, architecture, implementation, deployment, and evaluation of the API Scout tool.
