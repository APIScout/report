\section{Future Work}\label{sec:future-work}
The findings of this thesis open up several different avenues for possible future developments.
Below we have listed a few of them that could be interesting to investigate and possibly develop.

\begin{description}
    \item \textbf{Implement an algorithm to compute metrics for new specifications.} For now, the metrics have been provided by the database from which have taken our OpenAPI Specifications.
    It would be very useful to have an algorithm that would compute all the necessary metrics for each of the specifications added by some user.
    This would also eliminate the need for users to insert the metrics when sending the specifications to our backend, thus being able to have documents with identical structures in our database.
    \item \textbf{Implement a UI to show the evolution of APIs in time.} Another possible improvement would be the implementation of a User Interface (UI), which could graphically display both the structure and the changes made in each version of an OpenAPI Specification.
    In this way, the users could be able to see the evolution of an API at a glance.
    \item \textbf{Evaluate against other state-of-the-art embedding methodologies.} We could compare our embedding strategy with other state-of-the-art methodologies.
    In this way, we could have a more in-depth view of how our system performs.
