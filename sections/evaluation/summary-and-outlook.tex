\section{Summary and Outlook}\label{sec:summary-and-outlook-1}
In this section, we have shown and discussed some experiments that were performed on API Scout.
As we have seen, the system is almost always able to retrieve all the generated specifications within the first 10 results.
Moreover, the system seems to perform well overall, where the first retrieved documents are mostly relevant to the given query.
Finally, the retrieval speed increases linearly over time, and selecting only the \("\)metadata\("\) field leads to faster retrieval times overall.
In the next chapter, we will give some concluding remarks on the project and suggest some possible enhancements that could be implemented into API Scout in the future.
